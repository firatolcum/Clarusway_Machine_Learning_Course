    "Imagine you are working as a data scientist for an e-commerce company. One of the company’s task is to send out e-mail offers to customers with a proposal to buy certain products. Your job as a data scientist is to determine whether the contacted person will buy the product or not. All you have is a sample of customers that were contacted recently, their age and a variable whether or not they took action.\n",

Clearly, the Linear Regression algorithm will not work here since it only works for problems with a continuous outcome variable. On the other hand, the problem at hand is categorical i.e whether customers will buy a product( =1) or not( =0).\n",

Basically you try to fit in probabilities between 0 and 1, which are the two possible outcomes. You also decide a cut off value/threshold and then conclude that people with a probability higher than the threshold will buy the product and vice versa.\n",

    "**Logistic regression**(*aka Logit Regression, maximum-entropy classification (MaxEnt) or the log-linear classifier*) can be binomial,ordinal or multinomial. In the binomial or binary logistic regression, the outcome can have only two possible types of values (e.g. “Yes” or “No”, “Success” or “Failure”). Multinomial logistic refers to cases where the outcome can have three or more possible types of values (e.g., “good” vs. “very good” vs. “best” ). Generally, the outcome is coded as “0″ and “1″ in binary logistic regression.[Ordinal logistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_logit) regression deals with dependent variables that are ordered.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using a Validation dataset has a drawback. Firstly, it decreases the training data and secondly since it is tested against a small amount of data, it has high chances of overfitting. To overcome this, there is a technique called **[cross validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html)**. The most common form of cross validation, and the one we will be using, is called k-fold cross validation. ‘Fold’ refers to each different iteration that we train our model on, and ‘k’ just refers to the number of folds. In the diagram above, we have illustrated k-fold validation where k is 5.\n",
