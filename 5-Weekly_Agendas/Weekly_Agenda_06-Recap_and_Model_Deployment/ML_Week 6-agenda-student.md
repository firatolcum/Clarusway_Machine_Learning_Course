- Personal Questions (Study Environment, Kids etc.) 
- Any challenges (Classes, Coding, studying, etc.) 
- How you’re studying, you need personal advice? 
- Remember that practice makes perfect. 
- What exactly each student does for the team, if they know each other, if they care for each other, if they follow and talk with each other etc.

<h3><strong>Questions & Problems Related to Course Topics</strong></h4>
(The quiz questions stated here are to test yourself. Just try to answer them like you are in an interview, you don't need to spend much time on searching for the answers. You can check and discuss the answers on weekly meetings)
<hr>


**1. Answer the following questions below.**

<h3><strong>Interview Questions</strong></h4>
<hr>


**1. How would you scale your ML model?**

 

**2. You are given a data set. The data set contains many variables, some of which are highly correlated and you know about it. Your manager has asked you to run PCA. Would you remove correlated variables first? Why?**
